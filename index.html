        <h2> Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation").</h2>
        <p>
          As the first <b>governor-general of Pakistan</b>, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and
          policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan
          after the two states' independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at
          age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left
          a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named
          after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name. He is revered in
          Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is
          observed as a national holiday in Pakistan. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains
          Pakistan's greatest leader.

            There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a great competition
            and rivalry between the two. There is a third power stronger than both, that of the women.

            Think a hundred times before you take a decision, but once that decision is taken, stand by it as one man.

            Democracy is in the blood of the Muslims, who look upon complete equality of mankind, and believe in
            fraternity, equality, and liberty.

            No nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you. We are victims of
            evil customs. It is a crime against humanity that our women are shut up within the four walls of the houses
            as prisoners. There is no sanction anywhere for the deplorable condition in which our women have to live.

            With faith, discipline and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot achieve.

            Any idea of a United India could never have worked and in my judgment it would have led us to terrific disaster.
